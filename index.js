 * Okay MINIMUM (because I know you can imagine a web app for this, mais ...)
 * ... Quicktime has controls from applescript, which can be run from the CL ...
 * `brew install youtube-dl` ... Okay, well, now we know, if you run:
 * `youtube-dl [RSS FEED]` it will download them all starting from the most
 * recent, to present working directory. Okay, `youtube-dl -j --flat-playlist`
 * returns like object, newline, object, ai., so it just needs to be wrapped
 * in something and commas added, anyway, then you get data including url, title,
 * episode_number, all sorts of good stuff. I imagine ideally you could either pass
 * no arguments and it would give you a list starting with the most recent, or you
 * could pass an episode number to hit the ground running.
