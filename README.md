# Cription: Transcription Tool

> What's a cription?

How might we imagine a tool for transcribing, say, a podcast? I'd want keyboard shortcuts for changing to another speaker, and for skipping back a few seconds ... omg if you could play like beats along with it and gamify it? Oh wait, but that would create incentive to ignore detail, and honestly that's like the really beautiful, fun thing about spoken word written down ... almost like I think that the design details matter ... ahem, anyway, what if it encouraged a first run and then like immediately looped back and started at a higher speed, because the transcriber would just be doing more reading on further passes, right? Ooo, man! I'm going to save so many minutes by taking a few hours over the next week to write this ðŸ˜†
